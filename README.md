# COVID-19 Analysis Report

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide, presented using **Power BI**. The analysis provides insights into the spread of the virus, case fatality rates, and key metrics such as confirmed cases, and deaths, , visualized across different countries and regions.

## Project Objectives

- To visualize the global and country-level trends in COVID-19 cases and fatalities.
- To provide key metrics such as **Cases per 100K**, **Deaths per 100K**, **Case Fatality Rate (CFR)**.
- To allow users to filter and explore data by **time periods**, **continents**, and **countries**.
- To showcase data analytics and visualization skills using **Power BI**.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Users can interact with the visualizations to explore various COVID-19 metrics, such as confirmed cases, deaths.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Filter data by specific months, countries, or continents.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Visualize the trends over time for confirmed cases, deaths, and case fatality rates.
- **Rolling Averages**: 14-day rolling averages for confirmed cases to smooth out daily fluctuations.
- **Geographical Insights**: Explore how COVID-19 impacted different regions and continents using maps.
